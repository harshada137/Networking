üîê What is scp?
scp stands for Secure Copy Protocol. It is a command-line tool that allows you to securely transfer files or directories between two systems over a network using SSH (Secure Shell). It encrypts both the file
contents and authentication details, making it more secure than rcp or FTP.

- scp [options] source destination
   source: The file or directory to be copied (can be local or remote).
   destination: Where to copy the file or directory (can also be local or remote).

üìÇ Usage Examples
1. Copy File from Local to Remote
- scp myfile.txt username@remote_host:/home/username/ [command]
* This copies myfile.txt from your local machine to the /home/username/ directory on the remote server.

2. Copy File from Remote to Local
- scp username@remote_host:/home/username/myfile.txt /local/directory/ [command]
* This downloads the file from the remote system to your local machine.

3. Copy Directory (Recursively)
- scp -r myfolder username@remote_host:/home/username/
* Use -r to copy folders and their contents.

4. Specify SSH Port
- scp -P 2222 myfile.txt username@remote_host:/home/username/
* Use -P (capital P) to specify a custom SSH port (default is 22).

5. Use SSH Key for Authentication
- scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa myfile.txt username@remote_host:/home/username/
*  Uses a private key for login instead of a password.

6. Copy from One Remote Host to Another
- scp user1@host1:/path/file.txt user2@host2:/path/
* scp also supports transferring files between two remote servers, initiated from a third system.
