### 🔐 **Public Key & Private Key (Asymmetric Encryption)**

They are a pair of keys used in **asymmetric cryptography** — mainly for **secure communication, authentication, and encryption**.

#### 🔑 Public Key:

* Can be **shared with anyone**.
* Used to **encrypt** data.
* Cannot be used to decrypt the data it encrypts.
* Example use: When someone wants to send you a secure message, they use your **public key** to encrypt it.

#### 🔒 Private Key:

* Must be **kept secret** by the owner.
* Used to **decrypt** data encrypted with the matching public key.
* Also used to **sign** data digitally, proving authenticity.
