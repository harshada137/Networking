ðŸ“¡ OSI Model â€“ 7 Layers Explained in Detail
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how data travels from one device to another over a network. It consists of seven layers, each with a specific role in the 
data transmission process.

OSI Model â€“ 7 Layers (Simplified and Important Information)

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a standard that explains how data is transmitted over a network in 7 different layers. Each layer performs a specific role and helps with communication between 
systems.

1. Application Layer (Layer 7)

* Closest to the user.
* Provides services like web browsing, file transfer, and emails.
* Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS

2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

* Translates data so the application can understand it.
* Handles data encryption, decryption, and compression.
* Examples: SSL, TLS, JPEG, MP4

3. Session Layer (Layer 5)

* Manages sessions between two devices.
* Opens, maintains, and closes communication sessions.
* Examples: NetBIOS, PPTP

4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)

* Ensures complete and error-free data delivery.
* Performs segmentation, error handling, and flow control.
* Protocols: TCP, UDP

5. Network Layer (Layer 3)

* Determines the best path for data to reach its destination.
* Handles IP addressing and routing.
* Devices: Routers
* Protocols: IP, ICMP, OSPF

6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

* Transfers data between devices on the same local network.
* Adds MAC addresses and detects errors.
* Devices: Switches
* Protocols: Ethernet, PPP

7. Physical Layer (Layer 1)

* Deals with the physical connection between devices.
* Transmits raw bits over cables and hardware.
* Devices: Cables, Hubs, Network Interface Cards (NIC)
